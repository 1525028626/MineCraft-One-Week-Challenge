# MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge

I challenged myself to see if I could create Minecraft in just one week... So lets go!

# Day One

End of day one commit: https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/44ace72573833796da05a97972be5765b05ce94f

The first day was spent setting up boilerplate code such as the game state/ game screen system, and the basic rendering engines.

The day was finished off by creating a first person camera.

# Day Two

End of day one commit: https://github.com/Hopson97/MineCraft-One-Week-Challenge/tree/98055215f735335de80193221a30c0bb8586fba5

The second day was spent setting up the basic ChunkSection and various block classes.

I also worked out the coordinates for a cube, and thus created a cube renderer.

I finished up the day attempting to create a mesh builder for the chunk; however, this did not go well at all, and two had ended before I got it to work correctly.
